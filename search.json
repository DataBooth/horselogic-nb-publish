Files which satisfy the following conditions are excluded:\n\nAll files with _TEST_ as the subject name\nAll files with _FRECKLE_ as the subject name\nSome files with _BONNIE_ (14 legitimate files - TODO: CH to confirm details)\nAll files with test in the Comment field\nPossibly some logs with very short run-times - TODO: CH to confirm the files that have been identified\nAll files with _OLIVE_ as the subject name - probably discard, treat as optional for now (TODO: CH to confirm treatment)\n\n\n\nProblems with log file names during experiments\n\nAppears that for greater than 20 trials (subjects?) the value in the filename was reported as NaN. e.g. see pumba experiments.\nOther NaNs? There are 31 files with NaN (some are restarts) - TODO: Confirm with CH why were there restarts? Why not “new” experiment?\n\n\n\nTime differences\nFor each trial we calculate the following time differences:\n\nTime delta: (touch datetime - start tone datetime)\nTime delta: (Next start datetime - dispense of pellets datetime)\nTime delta: (Dispense final pellets datetime - start tone datetime)\n\nWe use item 3 as cross check on the consistency of previous time deltas.\nThese calculated quantities are the same for all RPE-type experiments.\n\n\n\nLoad Subject info"

    "text": "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you upload a local DuckDB database (file) to the MotherDuck server.\nThis allows you to share and collaborate on your database with others easily.\n\nPurpose\nThe main purpose of this notebook is to:\n\nSet up logging: Customise logging to track the process and any issues.\nLoad secrets: Load necessary secrets (like tokens/password) from a file to authenticate with MotherDuck.\nCheck local database: Verify if a local DuckDB database exists.\n\nUpload database: Copy the local DuckDB database to the MotherDuck server. Interact with the database: Perform SQL queries on the uploaded database.\n\n\nSteps\n\nImport necessary libraries: The notebook imports various libraries required for file handling, database operations, and logging.\nCustomise Logger: Sets up a logger to track the process and any issues.\nLoad Secrets: Loads the MotherDuck token from a .secrets.toml file.\nCheck Local Database: Checks if the local DuckDB database exists.\n\nUpload Database: Copies the local DuckDB database to the MotherDuck server. Interact with the Database: Connects to the uploaded database and performs SQL queries.\n\n\nHow to Use\nEnsure Dependencies: Make sure you have all the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip: Bash loguru Prepare Secrets File: Create a .secrets.toml file in the parent directory of your current working directory. This file should contain your MotherDuck token: ”\nRun the Notebook: Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially. The notebook will: - Set up logging. - Load the MotherDuck token. - Check for the local DuckDB database. - Upload the database to MotherDuck. - Allow you to interact with the uploaded database.\nCollaborate: Once the database is uploaded to MotherDuck, you can share access with your collaborators. They can connect to the database using sharing.\n\nExample Output\n\nDatabase Upload: The notebook will log the creation of the database on MotherDuck.\nSQL Queries: You can run SQL queries on the uploaded database and see the results directly in the notebook.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nLogging: Check the log file (DuckDBManager.log) for any errors or issues during the process.\nSecrets: Ensure your .secrets.toml file is correctly formatted and contains the right token.\n\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport duckdb\nimport toml\nfrom loguru import logger\n\n\ndef stdout_filter(record):\n    return record[\"level\"].name == \"INFO\" and \"ECHO\" in record[\"message\"]\n\ndef customise_logger(logger_filename=\"DuckDBManager.log\", logger_size=10, filter_func=stdout_filter, level=\"INFO\"):\n    try:\n        logger.remove(0) # Remove default output to sys.stderr\n        logger.add(sys.stdout, filter=filter_func, level=level)     # Add sys.stdout logging of select messages\n        logger.add(logger_filename, rotation=f\"{logger_size} MB\", level=level)  # logs will be written to file.log\n        logger.info(f\"ECHO: Logging to {logger_filename}: size = {logger_size} MB\")\n        logger.info(\"ECHO: Limited logging to stdout using `stdout_filter`\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error with customising logger: {e}\")\n\n\ncustomise_logger()\n\n\nlogger.info(f\"ECHO - Local DuckDB version: {duckdb.__version__}\")\n\n\nSECRETS_TOML = Path.cwd().parent / \".secrets.toml\"\n\n\ndef set_md_token(secrets_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Load secrets from a file and set the motherduck_token environment variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    if \"motherduck_token\" not in os.environ:\n        try:\n            secrets = toml.load(secrets_file)\n            os.environ[\"motherduck_token\"] = secrets[\"MD_TOKEN\"]\n            logger.info(f\"ECHO: Secrets loaded from {secrets_file} and MotherDuck environment variable set\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Failed to load secrets: {e}\")\n            raise\n    else:\n        logger.info(\"ECHO: MD environment variable already set.\")\n\n\ndef check_local_duckdb_database():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a local DuckDB database exists.
