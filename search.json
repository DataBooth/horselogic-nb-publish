    "text": "This repository is designed and built by Michael Booth of DataBooth in colloboration with the Research Leader Cathrynne Henshall.\n\n\nThe provided notebooks and supporting code are part of a data analysis pipeline for horse behavioral experiments. The primary goal is to process and analyse log files generated during these experiments, and to store this data in databases, for both Reward Prediction Error (RPE) and Cognitive Bias (CB) experiments.\nThe repository also contains the code for controlling the experiments performed on the RaspeberryPi (see the src directory).\n\n\n\nThe provided code and notebooks focus on two types of experiments: RPE and CB. The process is essentially the same for both RPE and CB experiments, with minor differences in data structure (e.g. an additional table ResponsesCB for CB experiments).\n\nLogfile Reconciliation: logfile-reconciliation-CB.ipynb logfile-reconciliation-RPE.ipynb\n\nPurpose: Identify which log files should be included or excluded from the analysis for each experiment type.\nSteps: - Load and Parse Log Files: Load log files and parse their filenames to extract metadata. - Apply Exclusion Rules: Exclude log files based on predefined rules (e.g., test runs, bad data). - Export Lists: Export lists of included and excluded log files for further processing.\n\nLogfile to Database:\n\n\nlogfile-to-database-CB.ipynb\nlogfile-to-database-RPE.ipynb\n\nPurpose: Load the reconciled log files into a DuckDB database for each experiment type.\nSteps: - Load Log Files: Load the log files determined to be included from the reconciliation step. - Parse and Extract Data: Extract relevant data from each log file and structure it for database insertion. - Insert Data into Database: Insert the parsed data into a DuckDB database.\n\nDatabase Queries:\n\n\ndatabase-queries-CB.ipynb\ndatabase-queries-RPE.ipynb\n\nPurpose: Cross-check the data in the databases and provide examples of typical queries for each experiment type.\nSteps: - Setup Database Connection: Connect to the DuckDB database. - Run SQL Queries: Execute SQL queries to verify data integrity and demonstrate typical data retrieval operations. - Provide Query Examples: Showcase various SQL queries that might be useful for future analysis.\nNote: These notebooks do not perform specific data analysis at this stage. They serve as a foundation for future analysis, which may be conducted in additional notebooks or external tools.\n\nCorrections to CB database:\n\n\ncorrections-to-database-CB.ipynb\n\nPurpose: For CB experiments only, load and apply manual corrections to the CB database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[1.

End]\n\n    classDef process fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n    class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J process;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the Diagram\n\nStart: The process begins with the loading of log files.\nLoad Log Files: Log files are loaded from a specified directory.\nParse Filenames: Filenames are parsed to extract metadata such as subject name and experiment type.\nApply Exclusion Rules: Predefined rules are applied to exclude certain log files. Handle Specific Files: Additional criteria are used to include or exclude specific log files.\nExport Included/Excluded Lists: Lists of included and excluded log files are exported for further processing.\nLoad Included Log Files: The included log files are loaded for detailed analysis.\nParse and Extract Data: Relevant data is extracted from each log file and structured for database insertion.\nInsert Data into DuckDB: The parsed data is inserted into a DuckDB database. For CB experiments only, manual corrections are loaded and applied.\nExport Database Tables: The database tables are exported to human-readable formats for review.\nEnd: The process concludes with the export of database tables.\n\nThis workflow ensures that only relevant and high-quality log files are included in the analysis, and the data is structured and stored in a database for both RPE and CB experiments. The process is designed to be flexible and repeatable for both experiment types, with minor adjustments to account for the differences in data structure. The database queries serve as a foundation for future in-depth analysis, providing a way to verify data integrity and demonstrate typical data retrieval operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe following (custom) modules are used to assist with the data transformations and analysis:\n\nLogfiles Module (logfiles.py): Handles the loading, parsing, and management of log files.\nProject Module (project.py): Manages project configuration, directory setup, and database initialisation.\nSubject Module (subject.py): Loads and processes subject information from external files, providing crucial data for both RPE and CB experiments.\nUtils Module: Provides utility functions for displaying class definitions.\n\nThe key custom classes to assist with the analysis are:\n\n\nThe Project class is like a central organiser for your research project. It helps you keep everything tidy and in the right place. Here’s what it does:\n\nSets up your project’s structure: It creates folders for your data, results, and other important files.\nManages your database: It sets up and maintains a database (by experiment type i.e. RPE or CB) where you can store all your experimental data.\nKeeps track of important information: It remembers things like what type of experiment you’re running and where all your files are located.\nProvides useful tools: It offers methods to help you do common tasks, like creating links to your files or exporting data.\n\nThink of the Project class as your personal assistant for your research project. It helps you stay organised and provides you with the tools you need to manage your experiments efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Subject class represents an individual participant in your experiment - in this case, a horse. It’s like a digital profile for each horse in your study. Here’s what it does:\n\nStores information about the horse: It keeps track of details like the horse’s name, cohort, and any other relevant characteristics.\nManages experimental data: It helps you organise and access the data collected for each horse during the experiments.\nProvides easy access to subject-specific information: It allows you to quickly retrieve information about a particular horse.\n\nThink of the Subject class as a digital folder for each horse in your study. It keeps all the information about that horse in one place, making it easy for you to access and manage data for individual subjects.\nTogether, these classes help you organise your research project, manage your data efficiently, and keep track of information about each participant in your study. They’re designed to make your research process smoother and more organised.\n\n\n\n\nLogfile Class: This is like a digital version of a physical log file. It can:\n\n\nRead and store the contents of a log file\nParse the filename to extract important information\nInterpret the contents of the file to create Experiment, Trial, and Event objects (for both RPE and CB experiments)\n\n\nLogs Class: This is like a file cabinet for all your log files. It can:\n\n\nFind all the log files in a specific folder\nLoad them into Logfile objects\nKeep track of which files are included or excluded from analysis\n\n\n\n\nThese are also located in logfiles.py.\n\nExperiment and ExperimentCB Classes: These are like digital record cards for each experiment. They store important information about an experiment, such as:\n\n\nWho participated (the subject or horse)\nWhen it happened\nWhat type of experiment it was\nAny comments or notes\nThe name of the log file\n\nThe ExperimentCB class is specifically for cognitive bias experiments and includes some extra details.\n\nTrial and TrialCB Classes: These represent individual trials within an experiment. They keep track of:\n\n\nWhen the trial started and ended\nWhat number trial it was\nFor cognitive bias trials (TrialCB), additional information like the type of response and direction\n\n\nEvent and EventCB Classes: These capture specific moments or actions during a trial. They record:\n\n\nWhat happened (the type of event)\nWhen it happened\nHow long into the trial it occurred\n\n\nRepsonseCB Class (CB experiments only): This is specific to cognitive bias experiments and records the subject’s responses, including:\n\n\nWhen the response occurred\nHow long it took (response time)\n\nThese classes work together to organise and make sense of the data from your experiments. They turn raw log files into structured data that’s easier to analyse and understand. The Logfile class does the hard work of interpreting each file, while the Logs class manages the collection of all your files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerDiagram\n    Experiments {\n        int ExperimentID PK \"Primary Key\"\n        varchar SubjectName\n        int SessionNumber\n        varchar ExperimentType\n        text Comment\n        varchar StartDateTime\n        varchar LogFileName\n        varchar MeasurementFileName\n    }\n\n    Parameters {\n        int ParameterID PK \"Primary Key\"\n        int ExperimentID FK \"Foreign Key\"\n        varchar ParameterName\n        varchar ParameterValue\n    }\n\n    Trials {\n        int TrialID PK \"Primary Key\"\n        int ExperimentID FK \"Foreign Key\"\n        int TrialNumber\n        datetime StartToneDateTime\n    }\n\n    Events {\n        int EventID PK \"Primary Key\"\n        int TrialID FK \"Foreign Key\"\n        varchar EventType\n        datetime EventDateTime\n    }\n\n    Experiments ||--o{ Parameters : \"has\"\n    Experiments ||--o{ Trials : \"has\"\n    Trials ||--o{ Events : \"has\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerDiagram\n    ExperimentCB ||--o{ TrialCB : contains\n    TrialCB ||--o{ EventCB : has\n    TrialCB ||--o| ResponseCB : may_have\n\n    ExperimentCB {\n        int ExperimentID PK\n        string Cohort\n        string SubjectName\n        int SubjectNumber\n        int SessionNumber\n        string SessionType\n        string ExperimentType\n        string Comment\n        datetime DateTime\n        string LogFileName\n        json Parameters\n    }\n\n    TrialCB {\n        int TrialID PK\n        int ExperimentID FK\n        int TrialNumber\n        string ResponseType\n        string TrialSubType\n        string Direction\n        string CriterionType\n        float CriterionCount\n        datetime TrialStartTime\n        datetime TrialEndTime\n        string SessionType\n    }\n\n    ResponseCB {\n        int ResponseID PK\n        int TrialID FK\n        float ResponseTime\n        datetime EventDateTime\n    }\n\n    EventCB {\n        int EventID PK\n        int TrialID FK\n        string EventType\n        datetime EventTime\n        float ElapsedTime\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMappings between the data classes and their corresponding DuckDB database tables:\n\n\n\nExperiment: Maps to the Experiments table, storing details about the experiment such as subject name, session number, and parameters.\nTrial: Maps to the Trials table, representing individual trials within an experiment with start and end times.\nEvent: Maps to the Events table, capturing specific events that occur during trials, including event types and timings.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimentCB: Maps to the ExperimentsCB table, similar to Experiment but includes a session type field for cognitive bias experiments.\nTrialCB: Maps to the TrialsCB table, representing trials in cognitive bias experiments with additional fields for response type and criteria.\nRepsonseCB: Maps to the ResponsesCB table, recording responses specific to cognitive bias trials, including response times.\nEventCB: Maps to the EventsCB table, capturing events during cognitive bias trials with relevant timing information."

The tags # | echo: false suppress the output of the Python code in a cell and only display the results (output from each cell.)

    "text": "Experiment details and naming conventions\nThere are two main types of Experiment:\n\nReward Prediction (RPE)\nCognitive Bias (CB)\n\nThe RPE have the following subtypes:\n\nRPE-A : acquisition of response\nRPE-H : habit formation\nRPE-E : extinction of response\nRPE-ER : extinction prior to reinstatement of response\nRPE-R : reinstatement of response\n\n\nRPE-type experiments\nA new experiment type (RPE-ER) was created during the experiments which was not in the original specification.\n\nLogfile Exclusion rules\nLogfiles that are from test runs and also bad data need to be excluded from the analysis.\nRules are case-insensitive. Files which satisfy the following conditions are excluded:\n\nAll files with _TEST_ as the subject name\nAll files with _FRECKLE_ as the subject name\nSome files with _BONNIE_ (14 legitimate files - TODO: CH to confirm details)\nAll files with test in the Comment field\nPossibly some logs with very short run-times - TODO: CH to confirm the files that have been identified\nAll files with _OLIVE_ as the subject name - probably discard, treat as optional for now (TODO: CH to confirm treatment)\n\n\n\nProblems with log file names during experiments\n\nAppears that for greater than 20 trials (subjects?) the value in the filename was reported as NaN. e.g. see pumba experiments.\nOther NaNs? There are 31 files with NaN (some are restarts) - TODO: Confirm with CH why were there restarts? Why not “new” experiment?\n\n\n\nTime differences\nFor each trial we calculate the following time differences:\n\nTime delta: (touch datetime - start tone datetime)\nTime delta: (Next start datetime - dispense of pellets datetime)\nTime delta: (Dispense final pellets datetime - start tone datetime)\n\nWe use item 3 as cross check on the consistency of previous time deltas.\nThese calculated quantities are the same for all RPE-type experiments.\n\n\n\nSetup project & directories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.1.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO     | Data directory: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/data\nINFO     | Data directory purpose: Parent directory for raw and processed data\nINFO     | Sql directory: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/sql\nINFO     | Sql directory purpose: Store SQL scripts\nINFO     | Output directory: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/notebooks/results/RPE\nINFO     | Output directory purpose: Store output files and results by experiment type\nINFO     | Logfiles directory: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/data/results/zips/data_17Jan2020_email_hillydale_equine\nINFO     | Logfiles directory purpose: Store for the raw log files\nINFO     | Notebooks directory: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/notebooks\nINFO     | Notebooks directory purpose: Jupyter notebooks for performing analysis\nINFO     | Existing database file deleted: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/data/Experiments_RPE_2023_Q4.ddb\nINFO     | Database file path: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/data/Experiments_RPE_2023_Q4.ddb\nINFO     | Database purpose: Main project databases (outputs) by experiment type\nINFO     | Project initialised (RPE): config defined in project_config.yaml\n\n\n\n# project.display_file_with_highlighting(\"project_config.yaml\")\n\n\n\nGet subject info\n\nsubject = Subject(project)\n\nsubject_df = subject.get_subject_info()\n\nINFO     | Loaded subject info from: /Users/mjboothaus/code/github/databooth/horse-logic/docs/from_CH/Cohort data for MB.xlsx\nINFO     | Subject count: 22\nINFO     | Sorted subject names:\n    apollo, ash, atom, bonnie, clover, dodge, dougie, dusty, filly, freya, george, gio, jelly, molly, mowgli, myrtle, \n    nix, olive, pumba, smudge, teddy, yoshi"
